<!-- JSX: -->

It allows you to HTML looking syntax that transformed into lightweight javascript Objects

check babeljs.io for more info

you can't use class attribute, use className

- use Pascal case for Component Names

## i.e MyFirstComponent

<!-- Class Components vs Functional Component -->

- we need to import React, Component in class Component
- We need to import React in Functional comp;

- need to have render method
- No need to have render method

- we can use an du[date the state info
- state can't be used inside functional Component

- props need not to be passed , access using this.props
- Need to pass props as param to the function.

- Both, Need to export Componentto use in other places.

Functional

- use props.children to access unnamed props.
  Ex: <User>Upendra</User>
  props.children will show Upendra inside of the functional Component

Props Vs state

setState:

- when setting state vartual dom comes into picture it will chekc for what part of the dom needs to change and it will update.

- setState is asynchronous, if you console state updated will not reflect immediately but dom will be updated after few seconds state data will be upadted

<!-- ---------------------- -->

Two way data binding

Below function calls on onclick on the button

- onclick={this.functionName}

Below function calls on page load, so avoid using brackets
-onclick={this.functionName()}

to send params, use bind function to this from call, apply, bind
it gives better performance

- onclick={this.funcionName.bind(this,'param value')}

for two way binding

use input

<input type="text" onChange={this.funcionName} value={this.state.inputValue}>

to receive the value in funcionName use event

functionName = (e) =>{
use e.target.value;
}

<!-- End -->
