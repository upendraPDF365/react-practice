<!-- JSX: -->
It allows you to HTML looking syntax that transformed into lightweight javascript Objects

you can't use class attribute, use className

## i.e MyFirstComponent

<!-- Class Components vs Functional Component -->

- we need to import React, Component in class Component
- We need to import React in Functional comp;

- need to have render method
- No need to have render method

- we can use an du[date the state info
- state can't be used inside functional Component

- props need not to be passed , access using this.props
- Need to pass props as param to the function.

- Both, Need to export Componentto use in other places.

Functional

- use props.children to access unnamed props.
  Ex: <User>Upendra</User>
  props.children will show Upendra inside of the functional Component
